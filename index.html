  <h2>"I find joy and excitement in writing code. From learning how to create my first program in Python, I unlocked a new level of enthusiasm and fascination for using code to analyze large data that ultimately provides the fuel for solving everyday practical problems. Programming is an ongoing and challenging puzzle that I enjoy solving because I believe in its power to help us make responsible decisions.</h2>

  <h2>When I am away from the keyboard, you can find me getting sunburnt while hiking through an ancient citadel, capsizing in the Pacuare River, or wandering aimlessly down the boulevards in the City of Light while appreciating the grand design of a fascinating world we live in."</h2>
